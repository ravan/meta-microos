SUMMARY = "Component library for systemd"
DESCRIPTION = "This library provides several of the systemd C APIs: \
 \
* sd-bus implements an alternative D-Bus client library that is \
  relatively easy to use, very efficient and supports both classic \
  D-Bus as well as kdbus as transport backend. \
 \
* sd-daemon(3): for system services (daemons) to report their status \
  to systemd and to make easy use of socket-based activation logic \
 \
* sd-event is a generic event loop abstraction that is built around \
  Linux epoll, but adds features such as event prioritization or \
  efficient timer handling. \
 \
* sd-id128(3): generation and processing of 128-bit IDs \
 \
* sd-journal(3): API to submit and query journal log entries \
 \
* sd-login(3): APIs to introspect and monitor seat, login session and \
  user status information on the local system."
