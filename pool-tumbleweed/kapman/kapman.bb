SUMMARY = "Pac-Man-like game by KDE"
DESCRIPTION = "Kapman is a clone of the well known game Pac-Man. You must go through the levels \
escaping ghosts in a maze. You lose a life when a ghost eats you, but you can \
eat the ghosts for a few seconds when eating an energizer. You win points when \
eating pills, energizers, and bonus, and you win one life for each 10,000 \
points. When you have eaten all the pills and energizers of a level, you go to \
the next level, and the player and ghost speeds increase. The game ends when you \
have lost all your lives."
